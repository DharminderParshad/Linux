Exploring learning

As we all know learning is not never ending process. Continues Learning will help to live a better life. But it is bit difficult to implement.
To overcome this I have created the concrete and achieveable plan. For this I have created the 90 days learning plan, in which I mentioned all the topics which I am going to learn.

In this I am going to learn Database, Unix, Writing skills

Process to implement
I have allocated 70-80 minute daily for learning and also I am writing down the key points for future reference.

Leaning strategy
Phase 1: Learn the overview about the topic.
Phase 2: Going depth to the topic learned in phase one and create the notes of it
I am using the pomodoro technique to acheive this

Problem faces
Usually while learning I forgot to take the notes of it. Because diving in the topic. Also I am not able to maintain the continuety of learning over the weekends

Wish to add one this learning plan
Want to learn one new english word on daily basis, so I can improve my vocablary
