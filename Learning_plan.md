Exploring learning

As we all know learning is a never ending process. Learning definetely helps a person to live a better life as it increases the learning capabilities with time. But it is bit difficult to implement unless you have set a goal to achieve it.

To overcome this, I have created a concrete and achieveable plan wherein I have kept a target of 90 days which includes topics which i think is important for me to move forward in my carrier.

The topic includes learning Database, Unix, and to improve my Writing skills.

So I think there should be some steps to implement my goals.

Like, I have allocated 70-80 minute daily for learning and also I am writing down the key points of my learning for future reference.

The strategy to execute my goals are:

Phase 1: Briefly learn the overview about a topic.
Phase 2: Going into the depth to a topic learned in phase one and create the notes for it.
I am using the pomodoro technique to acheive the above phases.

So,It is said that 'If you want to achieve something in life you have face challenges and come over it'.
I guess in achieving my goals too I will have few difficulties like..

Usually while learning I forget to take the notes of a topic I am learning as I dive in a topic. Also I am not able to maintain the continuety of learning over the weekends which I think I have to work on.

I also wish to add one more thing in my learning plan
Want to learn one new english word on daily basis, so I can improve my vocabulary

At the end of my 90 days leaning plan I guess I will be confident in ..

Understanding the basic concepts of database like (create table, linking, manging schemas, naming conventions, indexes), for
I can finish learning linux level 1 proficiency course and for my third topic ie

Writing skills, will help me write a blog in better way and also in making any documents in future using the knowledge which I will gain through my learning plan.
