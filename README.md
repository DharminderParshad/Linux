# Linux

Invention of Linux

Linux has its roots in Unix and Multics, two projects that shared the goal of developing a ![Image](/images/linus.jpg) multi-user operating system.

Unix developed out of the Multics project iteration at the Bell Laboratories’ Computer Sciences Research Center. The developers working on Multics at Bell Labs and elsewhere were interested in building a multi-user operating system with single-level storage, dynamic linking (in which a running process can request that another segment be added to its address space, enabling it to execute that segment’s code), and a hierarchical file system.

Who

Linus Torvalds invented Linux itself. In 1991, Torvalds was a student at the University of Helsinki in Finland where he had been using Minix, a non-free Unix-like system, and began writing his own kernel. He started by developing device drivers and hard-drive access, and by September had a basic design that he called Version 0.01.

post
Linus Torvalds announced to the world on August 25, 1991, with this newsgroup post:

Hello everybody out there using minix -

I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing since april, and is starting to get ready. I'd like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons) among other things).

I've currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work. This implies that I'll get something practical within a few months, and I'd like to know what features most people would want. Any suggestions are welcome, but I won't promise I'll implement them :-)

--opensource
The primary difference between Linux and many other popular contemporary operating systems is that the Linux kernel and other components are free and open-source software.


developed
The best thing about Linux is no one owns Linux. Unlike other operating systems like Microsoft’s Windows or Apple’s Mac and iOS. It doesn’t belong any big company.
It is open source. Anyone can you Linux under GPU licence. It is the community that develops Linux that power Linux. Linux is built collaboratively across companies, geographies and markets.

Linux has huge community of more than 10000 developers and 1000 companies , helping it to move towards the future.

maitained
A new kernel comes out every 2-3 months. This sort of speed is achieved by employing a unique collaborative developing technique. This technique has made Linux as the biggest collaborative development product.
