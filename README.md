# Linux

Invention of Linux

Linux has its roots in Unix and Multics, two projects that shared the goal of developing a multi-user operating system.

Unix developed out of the Multics project iteration at the Bell Laboratories’ Computer Sciences Research Center. The developers working on Multics at Bell Labs and elsewhere were interested in building a multi-user operating system with single-level storage, dynamic linking (in which a running process can request that another segment be added to its address space, enabling it to execute that segment’s code), and a hierarchical file system.

Linus Torvalds developed the first version of Linux in 1991 as an operating system for computers powered by the Intel 80386 microprocessor
